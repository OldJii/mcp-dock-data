      "description": "\n  Analyzes the content of a specified Obsidian Markdown file to automatically generate the most suitable properties (frontmatter) and updates the file directly.\n\n  Use Cases:\n  \n  - After Completing a Draft: Use when the body of the text is complete, and you want to generate all properties at once.\n  - Updating Information: Use when you want to update existing properties with more accurate information reflecting the latest content.\n  - Completing Missing Info: Use when you want to automatically add missing properties like tags or a summary to a document that only has a title.\n  \n  Parameters:\n  \n  filename: The name or path of the file to analyze and add properties to (e.g., \"my-first-post.md\").\n  overwrite: If set to true, existing properties will be overwritten by the AI-generated content. Default: false.\n  \n  Generated Properties:\n  \n  The AI analyzes the context of the content to generate the following properties:\n  \n  - aliases: An array of alternative names or synonyms based on the content.\n  - title: A title that best represents the core topic of the document.\n  - tags: An array of tags extracted from the core keywords of the content (e.g., [AI, Obsidian, productivity]).\n  - summary: A one to two-sentence summary of the entire document.\n  - slug: A hyphenated-string suitable for URLs, containing the core keywords from the content.\n  - date: The event date or creation date inferred from the content (in ISO 8601 format).\n  - completed: A boolean (true or false) indicating whether the content is considered a final version.\n  \n  Return Value:\n  \n  Upon success, returns a JSON object containing a success message that includes the modified filename.\n  { \"status\": \"success\", \"message\": \"Successfully updated properties for my-first-post.md\" }\n  \n  Requirements:\n  \n  The user's absolute path to the Obsidian vault must be correctly set in an environment variable.\n"
