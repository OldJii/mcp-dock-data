      "description": "Store conversation in memory for future reference. USE THIS TOOL: At the END of every conversation after fully answering the user. WHAT TO STORE: 1) User's question or request, 2) Your solution or explanation, 3) Important decisions made, 4) Key insights discovered. HOW TO USE: Put the entire conversation summary in the 'message' field. IMPORTANT: You MUST provide a sessionId - if you don't have one, call initialize_conversation_session tool FIRST to obtain it at the start of the conversation, then use that SAME sessionId for all memory_ingest calls. Optionally add spaceIds array to organize by project. Returns: Success confirmation with storage ID."

USE THIS TOOL: 1) At start of every conversation to find related context, 2) When user mentions past work or projects, 3) Before answering questions that might have previous context. HOW TO USE: Write a simple query describing what to find (e.g., 'user code preferences', 'authentication bugs', 'API setup steps'). Returns: Markdown-formatted context optimized for LLM consumption, including session compacts, episodes, and key facts with temporal metadata."

Each space organizes memories by topic (e.g., 'Profile' for user info, 'GitHub' for GitHub work, project names for project-specific context). Returns: Array of spaces with id, name, and description."

      "name": "memory_get_space",
      "description": "Get detailed information about a specific space including its full summary. USE THIS TOOL: When working on a project to get comprehensive context about that project. The summary contains consolidated knowledge about the space topic. HOW TO USE: Provide either spaceName (like 'core', 'GitHub', 'Profile') OR spaceId (UUID). Returns: Space details with full summary, description, and metadata."

      "name": "initialize_conversation_session",
      "description": "Initialize a session for this conversation. MUST be called FIRST at the start of every conversation before any memory_ingest calls. This generates a unique UUID that tracks the entire conversation session. IMPORTANT: One conversation = one session. Call this tool once at the beginning, store the returned sessionId, and use that SAME sessionId for ALL memory_ingest operations throughout this conversation. DO NOT create custom session IDs. Returns: A UUID string to use as sessionId for all subsequent memory operations."

Returns: Array with slug, name, accountId, and hasMcp for each integration."

For example, GitHub integration has actions like 'get_pr', 'get_issues', 'create_issue'. HOW TO USE: Provide the integrationSlug from get_integrations (like 'github', 'linear', 'slack').

Returns: Result of the action execution."
