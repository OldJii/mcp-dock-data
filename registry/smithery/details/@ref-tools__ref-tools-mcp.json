  "description": "Provide your AI coding tools with token-efficient access to up-to-date technical documentation for APIs, services, libraries, and more. Enable powerful search and reading capabilities to help your agent find precise information from documentation and web pages. \n\nLearn more:  https://ref.tools\n\nHow is this different from Context7?\n- Context7 works by looking up a library and giving you the 10k most relevant tokens. If you have 2 libraries, that's 20k tokens etc. It's unlikely you need all of that and it's costly. Ref uses on average 60% fewer tokens and up to 95% fewer (eg 500 tokens instead of 10000) in some cases.\n- Ref supports indexing private GitHub repos and PDFs so you can bring your own context as well.\n\nWant to chat or have a feature request?\n- Reach out to hello@ref.tools and say hi!",
