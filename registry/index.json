Cache opcional com KV se desejar\n* Sem dependência de serviços proprietários do lado do cliente\n\n## Tools disponíveis\n\n* `cnpj_lookup`\n  **Entrada**: `{ \"cnpj\": \"string\" }` com ou sem máscara\n  **Retorno**: dados cadastrais quando disponíveis, por exemplo razão social, nome fantasia, CNAE principal, natureza jurídica, situação, endereço\n\n* `cep_lookup`\n  **Entrada**: `{ \"cep\": \"string\" }` com ou sem máscara\n  **Retorno**: logradouro, bairro, município, UF, código IBGE e campos correlatos quando disponíveis\n\n## Endpoints\n\n* HTTP JSON-RPC: `/mcp`\n* Server-Sent Events: `/sse`\n* Saúde: `/health`\n\nExemplo de chamada JSON-RPC:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": \"1\",\n  \"method\": \"tools/call\",\n  \"params\": {\n    \"name\": \"cep_lookup\",\n    \"arguments\": { \"cep\": \"30130-010\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Integração rápida\n\n* **SSE**: aponte seu cliente MCP para `.../sse`\n* **HTTP**: aponte para `.../mcp` usando JSON-RPC 2.0\n  Funciona com agentes e IDEs compatíveis com MCP. Exemplos de configuração estão no repositório.\n\n## Casos de uso\n\n* Autocomplete de endereço a partir do CEP\n* Validação de CNPJ em fluxos de onboarding e KYC\n* Enriquecimento de dados em CRMs, ERPs e chatbots\n* Auditoria cívica e aplicações gov-tech locais\n\n## Privacidade e limites\n\nO servidor não persiste PII por padrão. Se o cache KV for habilitado, use políticas de retenção mínimas. Respeite limites das fontes públicas utilizadas. Planos e cotas do Cloudflare podem impactar throughput.\n\n## Código e docs\n\n* Repositório e exemplos: [https://github.com/cristianoaredes/mcp-dadosbr](https://github.com/cristianoaredes/mcp-dadosbr)\n* Documentação dos endpoints no README\n\n## Suporte\n\nAbra uma issue no GitHub para bugs, dúvidas e sugestões.

Specifications were scaffolding—built, used, then discarded once \"real work\" began. PRDs guided development, design docs informed implementation, but these were always subordinate to code. Code was truth. Everything else was, at best, good intentions.\n\nSpec-Driven Development inverts this power structure: \n\nSpecifications Generate Code: The PRD isn't a guide—it's the source that produces implementation\nExecutable Specifications: Precise, complete specs that eliminate the gap between intent and implementation\nCode as Expression: Code becomes the specification's expression in a particular language/framework\nLiving Documentation: Maintain software by evolving specifications, not manually updating code\nThis transformation is possible because AI can understand complex specifications and implement them systematically. But raw AI generation without structure produces chaos. DinCoder provides that structure through GitHub's proven Spec Kit methodology. \n\nPlugin install :\n**Step 1: Add the DinCoder marketplace**\n```bash\n# In Claude Code\n/plugin marketplace add flight505/dincoder-plugin\n```\n\n**Step 2: Install the plugin**\n```bash\n/plugin install dincoder\n```",

    "description": "# Docdex\n\n> **Turn your repository into fast, private context that humans and AI can trust.**\n\nDocdex is a **local-first indexer and search daemon** for documentation and source code. It sits between your raw files and your AI assistant, providing deterministic search, code intelligence, and persistent memory without ever uploading your code to a cloud vector store.\n\n## ⚡ Why Docdex?\n\nMost AI tools rely on \"grep\" (fast but dumb) or hosted RAG (slow and requires uploads). Docdex runs locally, understands code structure, and gives your AI agents a persistent memory.\n\n| Problem | Typical Approach | The Docdex Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Finding Context** | `grep`/`rg` (Noisy, literal matches) | **Ranked, structured results** based on intent. |\n| **Code Privacy** | Hosted RAG (Requires uploading code) | **Local-only indexing.** Your code stays on your machine. |\n| **Siloed Search** | IDE-only search bars | **Shared Daemon** serving CLI, HTTP, and MCP clients simultaneously. |\n| **Code Awareness** | String matching | **AST & Impact Graph** to understand dependencies and definitions. |\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Features\n\n* **📚 Document Indexing:** Rank and summarize repo documentation instantly.\n* **🧠 AST & Impact Graph:** Search by function intent and track downstream dependencies (supports Rust, Python, JS/TS, Go, Java, C++, and more).\n* **💾 Repo Memory:** Stores project facts, decisions, and notes locally.\n* **👤 Agent Memory:** Remembers user preferences (e.g., \"Use concise bullet points\") across different repositories.\n* **🔌 MCP Native:** Auto-configures for tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf.\n* **🌐 Web Enrichment:** Optional web search with local LLM filtering (via Ollama).\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Set-and-Forget Install\n\nInstall once, point your agent at Docdex, and it keeps working in the background.\n\n### 1. Install via npm (Recommended)\n\nRequires Node.js >= 18. This will download the correct binary for your OS (macOS, Linux, Windows).\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g docdex\n\n```\n\n### 2. Auto-Configuration\n\nIf you have any of the following clients installed, Docdex automatically configures them to use the local MCP server:\n\n> **Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Continue, VS Code, PearAI, Void, Zed, Codex.**\n\n*Note: Restart your AI client after installation.*\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Usage Workflow\n\n### 1. Index a Repository\n\nRun this once to build the index and graph data.\n\n```bash\ndocdexd index --repo /path/to/my-project\n\n```\n\n### 2. Start the Daemon\n\nStart the shared server. This handles HTTP requests and MCP connections.\n\n```bash\ndocdexd daemon --repo /path/to/my-project --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3210\n\n```\n\n### 3. Ask Questions (CLI)\n\nYou can chat directly from the terminal.\n\n```bash\ndocdexd chat --repo /path/to/my-project --query \"how does auth work?\"\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n\nDocdex is designed to be the \"brain\" for your AI agents. It exposes an MCP endpoint that agents connect to.\n\n### Architecture\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n  Repo[Repo on disk] --> Indexer[Docdex Indexer]\n  Indexer --> Daemon[Docdex Daemon]\n  Daemon -->|HTTP + SSE| MCPClient[MCP Client]\n  MCPClient --> Host[AI Agent / Editor]\n\n```\n\n### Manual Configuration\n\nIf you need to configure your client manually:\n\n**JSON (Claude/Cursor/Continue):**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"docdex\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3210/sse\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n**TOML (Codex):**\n\n```toml\n[mcp_servers]\ndocdex = { url = \"http://localhost:3210/v1/mcp\" }\n\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 capabilities & Examples\n\n### 1. AST & Impact Analysis\n\nDon't just find the string \"addressGenerator\"; find the **definition** and what it impacts.\n\n```bash\n# Find definition\ncurl \"http://127.0.0.1:3210/v1/ast?name=addressGenerator&pathPrefix=src\"\n\n# Track downstream impact (what breaks if I change this?)\ncurl \"http://127.0.0.1:3210/v1/graph/impact?file=src/app.ts&maxDepth=3\"\n\n```\n\n### 2. Memory System\n\nDocdex allows you to store \"facts\" that retrieval helps recall later.\n\n**Repo Memory (Project specific):**\n\n```bash\n# Teach the repo a fact\ndocdexd memory-store --repo . --text \"Payments retry up to 3 times with backoff.\"\n\n# Recall it later\ndocdexd memory-recall --repo . --query \"payments retry policy\"\n\n```\n\n**Agent Memory (User preference):**\n\n```bash\n# Set a style preference\ndocdexd profile add --agent-id \"default\" --category style --content \"Use concise bullet points.\"\n\n```\n\n### 3. Local LLM (Ollama)\n\nDocdex uses Ollama for embeddings and optional local chat.\n\n* **Setup:** Run `docdex setup` for an interactive wizard.\n* **Manual:** Ensure `nomic-embed-text` is pulled in Ollama (`ollama pull nomic-embed-text`).\n* **Custom URL:**\n```bash\nDOCDEX_OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434 docdexd daemon ...\n\n```\n\n\n\n---\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration & HTTP API\n\nDocdex runs as a local daemon serving:\n\n* **CLI Commands:** `docdexd chat`\n* **HTTP API:** `/search`, `/v1/ast`, `/v1/graph/impact`\n* **MCP Endpoints:** `/v1/mcp` and `/sse`\n\n### Multi-Repo Setup\n\nRun a single daemon and mount additional repos on demand.\n\n```bash\ndocdexd daemon --repo /path/to/repo-a --port 3210\n\n# Mount another repo and capture its repo_id\ncurl -X POST \"http://127.0.0.1:3210/v1/initialize\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"rootUri\":\"file:///path/to/repo-b\"}'\n```\n\nNotes:\n- When more than one repo is mounted, include `x-docdex-repo-id: <sha256>` on HTTP requests.\n- MCP sessions bind to the repo provided in `initialize.rootUri` and reuse that repo automatically.\n\n### Security\n\n* **Secure Mode:** By default, Docdex enforces TLS on non-loopback binds.\n* **Loopback:** `127.0.0.1` is accessible without TLS for local agents.\n* To expose to a network (use with caution), use `--expose` and `--auth-token`.\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Learn More\n\n* **Smithery:** [View on Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/server/@bekirdag/docdex)\n* **Detailed Usage:** `docs/usage.md`\n* **API Reference:** `docs/http_api.md`\n* **MCP Specs:** `docs/mcp/errors.md`\n",

Athenic adds an AI workforce to your assistant — so instead of just telling you what to do, it gets it done.\n\nWhat Sets Athenic Apart\n\n🚀 Long-Running Autonomous Tasks\nAthenic runs for hours, not minutes. Ask your assistant to “research my top 10 competitors and prepare a report” — and return to find a full, sourced analysis waiting for you.\n\n🤖 Multi-Agent Coordination\nAthenic orchestrates multiple AI agents — research, marketing, analytics — working together to complete full workflows end-to-end.\n\n🎯 Organization-Specific Intelligence\nIt learns your business.

    "description": "MCP fal.ai Image Server\n\nEffortlessly generate images from text prompts using fal.ai and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Integrates directly with AI IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf.\n\n## When and Why to Use\n\nThis tool is designed for:\n- Developers and designers who want to generate images from text prompts without leaving their IDE.\n- Rapid prototyping of UI concepts, marketing assets, or creative ideas.\n- Content creators needing unique visuals for blogs, presentations, or social media.\n- AI researchers and tinkerers experimenting with the latest fal.ai models.\n- Automating workflows that require programmatic image generation via MCP.\n\nKey features:\n- Supports any valid fal.ai model and all major image parameters.\n- Works out of the box with Node.js and a fal.ai API key.\n- Saves images locally with accessible file paths.\n- Simple configuration and robust error handling.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n1. Requirements: Node.js 18+, fal.ai API key\n2. Configure MCP:\n   {\n     \"mcpServers\": {\n       \"fal-ai-image\": {\n         \"command\": \"npx\",\n         \"args\": [\"-y\", \"mcp-fal-ai-image\"],\n         \"env\": { \"FAL_KEY\": \"YOUR-FAL-AI-API-KEY\" }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n3. Run: Use the generate-image tool from your IDE.\n\n💡 Typical Workflow:\nDescribe the image you want (e.g., “generate a landscape with flying cars using model fal-ai/kolors, 2 images, landscape_16_9”) and get instant results in your IDE.\n\n### 🗨️ Example Prompts\n\n- generate an image of a red apple\n- generate an image of a red apple using model fal-ai/kolors\n- generate 3 images of a glowing red apple in a futuristic city using model fal-ai/recraft-v3, square_hd, 40 inference steps, guidance scale 4.0, safety checker on\n\nSupported parameters: prompt, model ID (any fal.ai model), number of images, image size, inference steps, guidance scale, safety checker.\n\nImages are saved locally; file paths are shown in the response. For model IDs, see fal.ai/models.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- FAL_KEY environment variable is not set: Set your fal.ai API key as above.\n- npx not found: Install Node.js 18+ and npm.\n\nAdvanced: Example MCP Request/Response\n\nRequest:\n{\n  \"tool\": \"generate-image\",\n  \"args\": {\n    \"prompt\": \"A futuristic cityscape at sunset\",\n    \"model\": \"fal-ai/kolors\"\n  }\n}\n\nExample response:\n{\n  \"images\": [\n    { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image1.png\" },\n    { \"url\": \"file:///path/to/generated_image2.png\" }\n  ]\n}\n\n## 📁 Image Output Directory\n\nGenerated images are saved to your local system:\n\n- By default: ~/Downloads/fal_ai (on Linux/macOS; uses XDG standard if available)\n- Custom location: Set the environment variable FAL_IMAGES_OUTPUT_DIR to your desired folder. Images will be saved in /fal_ai.\n\nThe full file path for each image is included in the tool's response.\n\n## ⚠️ Error Handling & Troubleshooting\n\n- If you specify a model ID that is not supported by fal.ai, you will receive an error from the backend. Double-check for typos or visit fal.ai/models to confirm the model ID.\n- For the latest list of models and their capabilities, refer to the fal.ai model catalog or API docs.\n- For other errors, consult your MCP client logs or open an issue on GitHub.\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nContributions and suggestions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests on GitHub.\n\n## 🔒 Security\n\n- Your API key is only used locally to authenticate with fal.ai.\n- No user data is stored or transmitted except as required by fal.ai API.\n\n## 🛡 License\n\nMIT License © 2025 Madhusudan Kulkarni",

salary filters will exclude these jobs\n- **Rate limits apply** - the Adzuna API has usage limits on free tier\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nadzuna-mcp/\n├── server.py              # Main MCP server\n├── pyproject.toml         # Package configuration\n├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies\n├── .env.example           # Environment template\n├── .env                   # Your credentials (gitignored)\n├── tests/                 # Test suite\n│   ├── __init__.py\n│   └── test_server.py\n├── .github/\n│   └── workflows/\n│       ├── ci.yml         # CI pipeline\n│       └── publish.yml    # PyPI publishing\n├── CONTRIBUTING.md        # Contribution guide\n├── LICENSE\n├── .gitignore\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Server not appearing in Claude Desktop\n\n1. Check the Python path is correct in your config\n2. Ensure the virtual environment has all dependencies installed\n3. Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q / Alt+F4)\n4. Check Claude Desktop logs: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`\n\n### Authentication errors\n\n1. Verify your API credentials at [Adzuna Developer Portal](https://developer.adzuna.com/)\n2. Check the `.env` file has correct values\n3. Ensure environment variables are passed in the MCP config\n\n### No results returned\n\n1. Try broader search terms\n2. Check the country code is valid\n3. Remove salary filters (many jobs don't list salaries)\n4. Verify the category tag is valid for that country\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

    "displayName": "SoilWise – Intelligent Soil Health and Farm Optimization",
    "description": "SoilWise is an AI + IoT-powered agricultural system that helps farmers make data-driven decisions for better yield, sustainability, and profitability. Using soil sensors, satellite imagery, and market data, the platform evaluates soil health, predicts rainfall trends, and recommends optimal crop and fertilizer plans — while also scoring farm-level financial and sustainability performance.\n\nIt combines six smart modules:\n\n🧠 Soil Analysis: Automated detection of soil type, pH, and nutrient balance.\n\n🌾 AgriShield: Disease recognition and treatment recommendation using computer vision.\n\n💧 IrrigAIte: Smart irrigation planning based on moisture data and local weather.\n\n📈 Yield Predictor: ML-powered yield forecasting and credit scoring for farmers.\n\n🤖 AgriChat: Conversational assistant for personalized advice.\n\n📚 Research Checker: Validates agricultural research claims using AI evidence synthesis.\n\n🧩 MCP Architecture Flow\nINPUTS \n↓\n[MCP Logic Layer]\n↓\nOUTPUTS\n\n\nInput Layer:\n\n1.Soil sensor data (pH, moisture, nutrients)\n\n2.Satellite imagery and weather forecasts\n\n3.Farmer financial & field data (size, crop history)\n\n4.Market data from open agri APIs\n\nMCP Logic Layer:\n\n1.Data preprocessing & cleaning\n\n2.AI models (soil classification, disease detection, rainfall prediction)\n\n3.Predictive analytics for yield and credit scoring\n\n4.Generative AI for chatbot and recommendations\n\nOutput Layer:\n\n1.Personalized crop and fertilizer plans\n\n2.Financial risk and creditworthiness insights\n\n3.Rainfall and yield forecasts (3-month horizon)\n\n4.Interactive chatbot responses and visual dashboards\n\n⚙️ What the MCP Does\n\nThe MCP acts as the intelligent orchestration layer that links soil data, AI models, and farmer interfaces.\nIt performs:\n\n1.Real-time soil and satellite data processing\n\n2.Cross-model inference for health and yield prediction\n\n3.Dynamic decision generation (recommendations, warnings, or irrigation plans)\n\n4.Data logging for continuous model improvement\n\n🔗 How It Connects to the Client\n\nFrontend: Streamlit dashboard and SMS interface (via Africa’s Talking)\n\nMCP Server: Python backend (FastAPI + Streamlit) hosted on Azure Cloud MCP Node\n\nData Pipelines: Pulls from satellite APIs (Google Earth Engine), local sensor input, and OpenAI for natural language reasoning\n\nClient Access: Farmers, agronomists, and cooperatives can log in or subscribe via mobile or web for real-time guidance\n\n💡 Why It’s Useful or Creative\n\n1.Transforms soil and environmental data into instant, actionable insights — no labs or delays.\n\n2.Integrates AI, IoT, and financial scoring, giving farmers a holistic view of soil health + profitability.\n\n3.Localized intelligence: Tailored to microclimates and soil types in Sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa (Tunisia pilot).\n\n4.Scalable Design: Modular MCP architecture supports easy deployment across regions and languages.\n\n📊 Financial & Credit Scoring Module\n\na.Uses soil productivity metrics and yield forecasts to estimate farmer creditworthiness.\n\nb.Generates a SoilWise Credit Score to help farmers access loans or subsidies.\n\nPredictive metrics include:\n\n1.Historical yield potential\n\n2.Input efficiency\n\n3.Sustainability index\n\n4.Financial resilience model\n\n🚀 Deployment\n\na.Prototype Deployed: https://soilwise-prototype.streamlit.app/soilwise\n\nb.Backend Host: Azure Cloud with integrated MCP server\n\nc.Regions Tested: Western & Central Kenya (pilot), expanding to Tunisia for semi-arid adaptation\n\nd.Data Sources: Open Data Africa, Google Earth Engine, FAO Soil Database\n\n📁 Repository\n\n🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/antonie-riziki/SoilWise\n\n🏷️ Tags / Categories\n\n#AI #Agritech #IoT #MCP #SoilHealth #ClimateResilience #SustainableFarming #CreditScoring",

Gemini, Claude와 같은 최신 AI 클라이언트와 완벽하게 연동하여 로컬 HWPX 문서를 열람, 검색, 편집, 저장하는 풍부한 기능을 제공합니다.\n\n-----\n\n## ✨ 주요 기능\n\n  * **✅ 표준 MCP 서버 구현**: 공식 `mcp` SDK를 사용하여 안정적인 표준 입/출력 기반 서버를 제공합니다.\n  * **📂 제로 설정**: 별도 설정 없이 현재 작업 디렉터리를 기준으로 즉시 경로를 처리합니다.\n  * **📄 강력한 문서 편집**: 텍스트 추출, 페이지네이션부터 스타일, 표, 메모, 개체 편집까지 모두 가능합니다.\n  * **🛡️ 안전한 저장**: 자동 백업(`*.bak`) 옵션으로 예기치 않은 데이터 손실을 방지합니다.\n  * **🚀 즉시 실행**: `uv`만 있으면 `uvx hwpx-mcp-server` 한 줄로 바로 시작할 수 있습니다.\n\n## 🚀 빠른 시작\n\n### 1\\. `uv` 설치\n\n가장 먼저 파이썬 패키지 설치 도구인 `uv`를 설치하세요.\n[👉 Astral uv 설치 가이드](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)\n\n\n### 2\\. MCP 클라이언트 설정\n\n사용 중인 MCP 클라이언트 설정에 아래와 같이 서버 정보를 추가하세요.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"hwpx\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"hwpx-mcp-server\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"HWPX_MCP_PAGING_PARA_LIMIT\": \"200\",\n        \"HWPX_MCP_AUTOBACKUP\": \"1\",\n        \"HWPX_MCP_ENABLE_OPC_WRITE\": \"1\",\n        \"LOG_LEVEL\": \"INFO\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n### 3\\. 서버 실행 (로컬 환경에서 사용할 경우)\n\n터미널에서 아래 명령어를 실행하면 서버가 바로 시작됩니다.\n\n```bash\nuvx hwpx-mcp-server\n```\n\n> `uvx` 명령은 첫 실행 시 필요한 종속성을 자동으로 설치하며, 반드시 `python-hwpx 1.9` 이상의 버전이 준비되어야 합니다.\n\n\n> 서버는 실행된 현재 디렉터리를 기준으로 경로를 해석하므로, 별도의 작업 디렉터리 설정 없이 바로 사용할 수 있습니다.\n\n## ⚙️ 환경 변수\n\n| 변수 | 설명 | 기본값 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `HWPX_MCP_PAGING_PARA_LIMIT` | 페이지네이션 도구가 반환할 최대 문단 수 | `200` |\n| `HWPX_MCP_AUTOBACKUP` | `1`이면 저장 전 `<file>.bak` 백업 생성 | `0` |\n| `HWPX_MCP_ENABLE_OPC_WRITE` | `package_set_text` / `package_set_xml` 사용 허용 | `0` |\n| `LOG_LEVEL` | stderr에 JSONL 형식으로 출력할 로그 레벨 | `INFO` |\n\n> ℹ️ `read_text` 도구는 기본적으로 최대 200개의 문단을 반환합니다. 더 큰 덤프가 필요하면 도구 호출 시 `limit` 인수를 직접 지정하거나 `HWPX_MCP_PAGING_PARA_LIMIT` 환경 변수를 확장하세요. 이는 Microsoft Office Word에서 필요한 범위만 순차적으로 읽는 워크플로와 동일합니다.\n\n## 🛠️ 제공 도구\n\n다양한 문서 편집 및 관리 도구를 제공합니다. 각 도구의 상세한 입출력 형식은 `ListTools` 응답에 포함된 JSON 스키마를 통해 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n\\<details\\>\n\\<summary\\>\\<b\\>전체 도구 목록 펼쳐보기...\\</b\\>\\</summary\\>\n\n  -

Unified Schedule & Notes Management\n\n* **Description Field as Notes**\n  No separate note-taking app needed. All details you provide when creating an event (agenda, preparation notes, links, etc.) are stored directly in the **Google Calendar “Description”** field.\n* **Single Source of Truth**\n  Everything lives in Google Calendar, fully synced across web and mobile.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Automatic Color-Based Categorization (3 Core Types)\n\nThe AI analyzes each event and automatically assigns a calendar color based on its purpose.\nNo tags in titles—your calendar stays clean and readable.\n\n| Category            | Calendar Color      | Use Case                                |\n| ------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| **Work**            | 🔵 Blueberry (Blue) | Meetings, deadlines, project tasks      |\n| **Personal**        | 🟢 Basil (Green)    | Hobbies, workouts, personal plans       |\n| **Family / Events** | 🔴 Tomato (Red)     | Weddings, family gatherings, ceremonies |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Smart Search & Alerts\n\n* **Flexible Queries**\n  Retrieve today’s events, the next 7 days, or up to 30 days at once.\n* **Urgent Email Alerts**\n  If an event starts within the next 2 hours, a detailed notification (including notes) can be sent to a designated email address.\n* **Natural Deletion**\n  Say things like *“Cancel my afternoon schedule today”* or\n  *“Delete the ‘Gym’ event I added yesterday”* — the server finds and removes the correct event.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 AI Assistant Conversation Examples\n\nOnce the MCP server is installed, use it with AI clients (e.g. Claude) like this:\n\n> **Create an Event**\n> “Add a work meeting today at 3 PM.\n> In the notes, write ‘Meeting Room B, bring weekly report.’”\n> *(Result: The event is saved in blue with notes included.)*\n\n> **Custom Search**\n> “Show me all family-related events scheduled for this week.”\n> *(Result: Events are filtered using calendar color categorization.)*\n\n> **Urgent Alert**\n> “Check for events starting within the next 2 hours and send me an urgent email alert.”\n> *(Result: An email is sent with detailed event information.)*\n\n> **Help Request**\n> “How do I use this server?”\n> *(Result: The built-in helper tool explains all features and categories.)*\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Notes\n\n* **Initial Authorization**\n  When you use the tools for the first time, a browser window will open for Google account authentication.\n  After completing login once, future connections are automatic.\n\n\n\n\n# 📅 Google Calendar Smart Manager (MCP)\n\n구글 캘린더를 당신의 똑똑한 비서로 만들어주는 MCP 서버입니다. 복잡한 일정 관리와 흩어진 메모를 AI와 대화하며 한곳에서 체계적으로 관리하세요.\n\n---\n\n## 🌟 핵심 가이드\n\n### 1. 일정 & 메모 통합 관리\n* **설명(Description) 필드 활용**: 별도의 메모 앱이 필요 없습니다. 일정 등록 시 전달하는 모든 세부 사항(회의 안건, 준비물 등)은 구글 캘린더의 **'설명'** 칸에 즉시 저장됩니다.\n* **통합 저장소**: 모든 데이터가 구글 캘린더 하나에 모이므로 모바일과 웹 어디서든 동기화된 일정을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 2. 색상 기반 자동 분류 (3대 카테고리)\nAI가 일정의 성격을 파악하여 캘린더의 색상을 자동으로 지정합니다. 제목 앞에 별도의 태그를 붙이지 않아 캘린더 뷰가 매우 깔끔합니다.\n\n| 카테고리 | 캘린더 색상 | 용도 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **업무 (Work)** | 🔵 파란색 (Blueberry) | 회의, 마감일, 프로젝트 업무 등 |\n| **개인 (Personal)** | 🟢 연두색 (Basil) | 취미, 운동, 개인 약속, 할 일 등 |\n| **경조사 (Family)** | 🔴 빨간색 (Tomato) | 결혼식, 제사, 가족 모임 등 중요 행사 |\n\n### 3. 스마트 검색 및 알림\n* **유연한 조회**: 오늘, 이번 주(7일)는 물론 최대 30일치 일정을 한 번에 불러옵니다.\n* **긴급 이메일 알림**: 2시간 이내에 시작되는 급박한 일정이 있다면, 상세 메모를 포함하여 지정된 이메일로 즉시 알림을 보냅니다.\n* **간편한 삭제**: \"오늘 오후 일정 취소됐어\" 또는 \"어제 등록한 '헬스장' 일정 삭제해줘\"라고 하면 관련 일정을 찾아 정리합니다.\n\n---\n\n## 💬 AI 비서 대화 예시\n\n설치된 MCP 도구를 활용해 AI(Claude 등)에게 다음과 같이 요청해 보세요.\n\n> **일정 등록**\n> \"오늘 오후 3시에 팀 미팅 업무로 등록해줘. 메모에는 '회의실 B, 주간 보고서 지참'이라고 적어줘.\"\n> *(결과: 파란색으로 일정과 메모가 함께 저장됩니다.)*\n\n> **맞춤 조회**\n> \"이번 주에 잡힌 경조사 일정들만 싹 모아서 보여줘.\"\n> *(결과: 색상 코드를 분석하여 경조사 카테고리만 필터링합니다.)*\n\n> **긴급 알림**\n> \"지금부터 2시간 내에 있는 일정을 확인해서 내 메일로 긴급 알람 보내줘.\"\n> *(결과: 2시간 내 일정을 체크하여 상세 내용과 함께 이메일을 발송합니다.)*\n\n> **도움말 요청**\n> \"이 서버는 어떻게 쓰는 거야?\"\n> *(결과: 내장된 Helper 도구가 모든 기능과 카테고리 사용법을 안내합니다.)*\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 참고 사항\n* **최초 인증**: 서버 연결 후 도구를 처음 사용할 때, 구글 계정 로그인을 위한 브라우저 창이 한 번 열립니다. 로그인을 완료하면 이후에는 자동으로 연결됩니다.\n",

    "description": "# Auto Terminal\n\n<img src=\"app_icon.png\" width=\"128\" />\n\n[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-FFDD00?style=for-the-badge&logo=buy-me-a-coffee&logoColor=black)](https://buymeacoffee.com/hs03)\n\n**Auto Terminal** is a powerful process manager and terminal automation tool that doubles as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. It allows AI agents (like Cursor, Claude Desktop) to execute terminal commands, manage background processes, and monitor output in real-time.\n\n## Features\n\n- **GUI & MCP Hybrid**: Runs as a standalone GUI application or a background MCP server.\n- **Process Management**: Start, stop, and restart background processes easily.\n- **Real-time Logs**: View live stdout/stderr logs for any running process.\n- **Terminal Automation**: Execute arbitrary shell commands via MCP tools.\n- **MacOS Optimized**: Native Dock icon support.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hoseoglee/auto-terminal.git\ncd auto-terminal\n\n# Create virtual environment\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Install dependencies\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### 1. GUI Mode\nRun the application with a graphical interface to manage processes manually.\n\n```bash\npython gui_launcher.py\n```\n\n### 2. MCP Server Mode\nThis project uses `fastmcp` to expose tools to AI agents.\n\n#### Arguments\n- `--mcp`: Starts in MCP mode.\n- `--sse`: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport (default on port 8000).\n\n## MCP Configuration (for Cursor / Claude)\n\nAdd the following configuration to your `config.json` (Cursor) or `claude_desktop_config.json`.\n\n**Option A: Run Directly (stdio)**\n*Recommended for local usage.*\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"auto-terminal\": {\n      \"command\": \"/absolute/path/to/auto-terminal/.venv/bin/python\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"/absolute/path/to/auto-terminal/gui_launcher.py\",\n        \"--mcp\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: SSE Mode**\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"auto-terminal\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:8000/sse\",\n      \"transport\": \"sse\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Available Tools\n\nThe MCP server exposes the following tools to the AI:\n\n- `list_programs()`: List configured and running processes.\n- `start_program(name)`: Start a specific program.\n- `stop_program(name)`: Stop a running program.\n- `restart_program(name)`: Restart a program.\n- `run_terminal_command(command, name, cwd)`: Execute any shell command.\n- `get_program_logs(name, lines)`: Fetch recent logs.\n- `send_program_input(name, input_text)`: Send stdin to a process.\n- `add_program_config(name, command, cwd)`: Save a new program configuration.\n- `remove_program_config(name)`: Remove a configuration.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License\n",
