      "description": "Get all tasks from Todoist using a filter.\n\nFilters are custom views for your tasks based on specific criteria. You can narrow down your lists according to task name, date, project, label, priority, date created, and more.\n\nThere are a range of symbols you can use to filter the tasks. For example, 'today' will get all tasks due today.\n\nHere’s a rundown of some of the more advanced filters you can use in Todoist:\n\nIn order to create filters based on keywords, you can use `search`: followed by a keyword.\n- See all tasks that contain the word \"Meeting\", use this: \"search: Meeting\"\n- See all tasks that contain the word \"Meeting\" that are due today, use this: \"search: Meeting & today\"\n- See all tasks that contain either the word \"Meeting\" or \"Work\", use this: \"search: Meeting | search: Work\"\n- See all tasks that contain the word \"email\", use this: \"search: email\"\n- See all tasks that contain web links, use this: \"search: http\"\n\nCreate a filter to either see or exclude sub-tasks in the view:\n- See all sub-tasks, use this: \"subtask\"\n- See all parent tasks while excluding their sub-tasks, use this: \"!subtask\"\n\nSee all tasks scheduled for a specific date:\n- View all tasks scheduled for January 3rd, use this: \"date: Jan 3\"\n- See all tasks dated before a specific date, use this: \"date before: May 5\" or \"date before: 5/5\"\n- See all tasks dated after a specific date, use this: \"date after: May 5\" or \"date after: 5/5\"\n- See all tasks scheduled within the next four hours and all overdue tasks, use this: \"date before: +4 hours\"\n- See all tasks dated in the current working week, use this: \"date before: sat\"\n- See all tasks that are dated for next week, use this: \"(date: next week | date after: next week) & date before: 1 week after next week\"\n- See all tasks dated within the current calendar month, use this: \"date before: first day\"\n- See active tasks dated yesterday, along with today's tasks listed below, use this: \"date: yesterday, today\"\n- See all tasks that have no date associated with them, use this: \"no date\"\n- See all tasks with a date assigned to them, use this: \"!no date\"\n- See all tasks with a date and time assigned to them, use this: \"!no date & !no time\"\n- See all tasks dated today and before a specific time, use this: \"date: today & date before: today at 2pm\"\n- See all tasks that are overdue, use this: \"Overdue\" or \"over due\" or \"od\"\n- See all tasks that are overdue and have had time assigned to them, along with all tasks dated today and with time assigned to them, use this: \"overdue & !no time, date: today & !no time\"\n- See all tasks in your Inbox without a date, followed by a separate section with all your tasks that have dates set, but are not in your Inbox: \"#Inbox & no due date, All & !#Inbox & !no due date\"\nYou can write a date in any of these ways:\n- Specific date: 10/5/2022, Oct 5th 2022\n- Specific date and time: 10/5/2022 5pm, Oct 5th 5pm\n- Relative date: today, tomorrow, yesterday, 3 days (dated in the next 3 days), -3 days (dated in the past 3 days)\n- Days of the week: Monday, Tuesday, Sunday\n\nExamples with deadlines:\n- See all tasks with no deadlines, use this: \"no deadline\"\n- See all tasks with a deadline, use this: \"!no deadline\"\n- See all tasks with a deadline today, use this: \"deadline: today\"\n- See all tasks with a deadline within the next 7 days: \"deadline after: yesterday & deadline before: in 7 days\"\n- See all tasks with overdue deadlines: \"deadline before: today\"\n\nDue takes into consideration the date and deadline fields. If a task has both, a date and deadline, due prioritizes the date. If the task does not have a date, due will check if the deadline matches filter criteria. If you don't use deadlines, due and date filters will return the same results.\n- View all tasks due on January 3rd: \"Jan 3\"\n- See all tasks that are due before a specific date, use this: \"due before: May 5\" or \"due before: 5/5\"\n- See all tasks that are due after a specific date, use this: \"due after: May 5\" or \"due after: 5/5\"\n- See all tasks due within the next four hours and all
