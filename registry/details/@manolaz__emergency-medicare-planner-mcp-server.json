      "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective medical problem-solving through thoughts.\nThis tool helps analyze medical problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding of the medical situation deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex medical problems into steps\n- Planning and designing treatment approaches with room for revision\n- Clinical analysis that might need course correction\n- Medical problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Healthcare decisions that require a multi-step solution\n- Medical evaluations that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant medical information needs to be filtered out\n\nKey features:\n- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as the diagnosis progresses\n- You can question or revise previous medical assessments\n- You can add more diagnostic thoughts as new information emerges\n- You can express clinical uncertainty and explore alternative approaches\n- Not every medical assessment needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack\n- Generates a clinical hypothesis\n- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n- Repeats the process until a satisfactory diagnosis or treatment plan is reached\n- Provides a correct medical assessment or recommendation"
