If no or no previous transactions, ask for email. 2) If user has NOT provided portal_key, call get_portals first to show list and ask user to select. 3) If user has NOT specified payment_channel, call get_payment_channels to show list and ask user to select. 4) Ask user if they want to provide payer telephone number (optional, Malaysia numbers only). 5) If user already provided these values in their message, use them directly. IMPORTANT: After creating payment, store the returned \"id\" field (e.g., pi_pGwAaq) - this can be used later to check payment status with get_payment_intent tool."
