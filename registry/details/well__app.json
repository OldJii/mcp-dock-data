Call well_get_schema(root) to see available fields\n2. Pick the fields you need for your task (typically 5-15)\n3. Call well_query_records with those specific fields\n\nReturns field paths like:\n- \"invoices.grand_total\" → scalar field\n- \"invoices.issuer.name\" → relationship field (company name)\n- \"invoices.receiver.name\" → relationship field\n\nTo use in well_query_records, convert path to array:\n\"invoices.issuer.name\" → [\"invoices\", \"issuer\", \"name\"]"
