If nothing is relevant, respond: \"No suitable templates found.\"\n\nUse when:\n- The user wants to browse, search, or choose a template/variant.\n- Before recommending or starting a render for a targeted campaign, platform, or audience.\n\nFollow-ups:\n- `get_renderable_item_details` — fetch the full parameter schema/defaults for the chosen template/variant before rendering.\n      "

Ensure the URL is publicly accessible and points directly to the media file.\n      - MEDIA (image): URL to an image file (jpg, png, etc.).\n      - MEDIA (audio): URL to an audio file (mp3, wav, etc.).\n      - MEDIA (video): URL to a video file (mp4, mov, etc.).\n      - COLOR: hex color code (e.g. FF5733).\n- If a parameter has a default value and the user does not provide a value, the default will be used.\n- If the user is unsure about a parameter, ask for clarification rather than guessing.\n- When referencing parameters in conversation, use their `label` or `description` for clarity.\n\nUse when:\n- The user wants to create a video from a specific template/variant with defined parameters.\n      "
