Use this tool when TideWave is not available or for searching packages not in your current project.\n\nQuery Syntax:\n- Basic search: \"Phoenix.LiveView\" (searches for both terms)\n- Exact phrase: \"\\\"handle event\\\"\" (use escaped quotes)\n- AND operator: \"Phoenix AND LiveView\" (both terms required)\n- OR operator: \"Phoenix OR Plug\" (either term)\n- Exclude terms: \"Phoenix -test\" (minus sign excludes)\n- Module/function: \"Enum.map\" or \"GenServer.handle_call\"\n\nBest Practices:\n- Use exact module.function names for precise results\n- Combine with packageName filter for focused search\n- Use quotes for multi-word exact phrases\n- For callbacks use patterns like \"@callback handle_\"\n- For types use patterns like \"@type t()\"\n\nExamples:\n- Find LiveView event handlers: query: \"handle_event\", packageName: \"phoenix_live_view\"\n- Find Ecto changesets: query: \"changeset\", packageName: \"ecto\"\n- Find specific function: query: \"\\\"Enum.map/2\\\"\"\n- Find type definitions: query: \"@type\", packageName: \"phoenix\""
