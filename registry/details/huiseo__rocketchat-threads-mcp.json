First, try global search WITHOUT roomId - this searches all channels at once\n2. If global search fails with \"roomId required\" error, then use channel-specific search\n3. Do NOT loop through channels - global search is much more efficient\n\n**OpenSearch Dependency:**\n- WITHOUT roomId (global search): REQUIRES OpenSearch integration - searches ALL channels\n- WITH roomId: Works on all servers but only searches ONE channel\n\nReturns:\n- Search summary (query, total results, time range)\n- Matching messages with full details (including which channel/roomId each message is from)\n- Thread IDs for messages that are thread parents\n- Highlighted text snippets (when OpenSearch is available)\n\n**When to use which tool:**\n- rocketchat_search_messages: Find messages by keyword (fast, single messages)\n- rocketchat_search_threads: Find discussions/decisions (searches replies too)\n- rocketchat_get_messages: Browse recent messages chronologically\n\n**Error Handling:**\n- If \"roomId required\" error: Server lacks OpenSearch, provide roomId\n- If empty results: Try broader search terms\n\nExamples:\n- Global search (RECOMMENDED): { \"query\": \"삼성전자\" }\n- Global search (RECOMMENDED): { \"query\": \"authentication\" }\n- Channel-specific (only if needed): { \"query\": \"API integration\", \"roomId\": \"GENERAL\" }"
