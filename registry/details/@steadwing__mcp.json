      "description": "Analyze errors and debug issues with AI-powered root cause analysis.\n\nWHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:\n- When user provides an error message, stack trace, or error description for analysis and asks for root cause analysis\n- When the user explicitly mentions \"Steadwing\" or asks for error analysis\n\nWHAT THIS TOOL RETURNS:\n- Returns a direct URL to the incident on the Steadwing platform\n- Analysis happens in the background and results can be viewed by visiting the provided URL\n\nHOW TO PROVIDE FILES (Optional but STRONGLY RECOMMENDED):\n1. Always include files when available for better analysis accuracy\n2. Start with the file mentioned in the error stack trace or error message\n3. Include files that are directly imported or used by the failing code\n4. Include configuration files if the error relates to setup/initialization\n5. Include test files if the error occurs during testing\n6. Focus on files most likely related to the error context (max 20 files)\n\nUSAGE EXAMPLE:\n{\n  \"error\": \"TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined at processData (app.js:45)\",\n  \"files\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"src/app.js\",\n      \"content\": \"function processData(data) { return data.length; }\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"src/utils.js\",\n      \"content\": \"export function getData() { return null; }\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
