      "description": "A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.\nThis tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.\nEach thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Problems that require a multi-step solution\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\nYou should:\n1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust\n2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the \"end\"\n4. Express uncertainty when present\n5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step\n7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate\n8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps\n9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution\n10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output\n11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached"
