      "description": "Converts a color from one format to another. Supports all major color formats including hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, oklch, oklab with full alpha/transparency support. Input can be any valid color string (hex, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, oklch, oklab, or named colors like 'red', 'blue'). Alpha values are preserved when converting between alpha-supporting formats, removed when converting to non-alpha formats. Available output formats: 'hex' (#FF0000), 'rgb' (rgb(255,0,0)), 'hsl' (hsl(0,100%,50%)), 'oklch' (oklch(63.3% 0.254 19.9)), 'oklab' (oklab(0.633 0.025 0.013)). Example: convert color '#FF0000' to format 'oklch'."
