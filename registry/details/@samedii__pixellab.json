Saves 5,000-20,000 tokens per image!\n  Note: Large images (>192×192) may cause \"argument list too long\" error with curl.\n\n- **Base64** (uses many tokens):\n  ```json\n  {\"type\": \"base64\", \"base64\": \"iVBORw0KGgo...\"}\n  ```\n  Sends image inline. Use only for small images or when curl isn't available.\n\n**Inpainting Options:**\n\n- **Default** (when background_image provided without inpainting):\n  - Automatically uses: `{\"type\": \"oval\", \"percentage\": 0.6}`\n  - Covers 60% of image with centered oval\n  - Good starting point for most objects\n\n- **Oval** (explicit): `{\"type\": \"oval\", \"percentage\": 0.3}`\n  - Auto-generates centered oval mask\n  - Percentage controls size (0.3 = 30% of background)\n  - Good for round objects (trees, pots, rocks)\n\n- **Rectangle**: `{\"type\": \"rectangle\", \"percentage\": 0.5}`\n  - Auto-generates centered rectangle mask\n  - Percentage controls size (0.5 = 50% of background)\n  - Good for buildings, chests, signs\n\n- **Custom Mask**: `{\"type\": \"mask\", \"mask_image\": \"base64...\"}`\n  - Provide your own mask for precise control\n  - Black (0,0,0) = frozen context for AI to see\n  - White (255,255,255) = area to generate object\n\n**How Style Matching Works:**\n- AI analyzes frozen (black) pixels around the generation area\n- Automatically matches colors, shading, detail level, and art style\n- Only generates in white mask area (oval/rectangle/custom)\n\nReturns immediately with job ID. Generation takes ~15-30 seconds.\nUse get_map_object to check status and retrieve results."
