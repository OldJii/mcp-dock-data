Limit the crawl depth and number of pages, or use map + batch_scrape for better control.\n**Common mistakes:** Setting limit or maxDepth too high (causes token overflow); using crawl for a single page (use scrape instead).\n**Prompt Example:** \"Get all blog posts from the first two levels of example.com/blog.\"\n**Usage Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"firecrawl_crawl\",\n  \"arguments\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://example.com/blog/*\",\n    \"maxDepth\": 2,\n    \"limit\": 100,\n    \"allowExternalLinks\": false,\n    \"deduplicateSimilarURLs\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n**Returns:** Operation ID for status checking; use firecrawl_check_crawl_status to check progress.\n"
